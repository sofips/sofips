### 👋 About me

I am a PhD student in Physics with a strong academic background in **machine learning, data science, and optimization**.

My research focuses on applying **reinforcement learning, genetic algorithms, and neural networks** to complex quantum systems, involving high-dimensional optimization, noisy environments, and rigorous model evaluation. This work has led to peer-reviewed publications and international conference presentations.

Alongside my doctoral research, I have **completed a Data Science Diploma**, where I worked on applied projects using real-world datasets, including **natural language processing with embeddings**, supervised learning on medical data, **clustering and representation learning**, and **offline recommendation systems** based on sequential models.

I regularly run experiments on **remote university servers and shared computing infrastructure**, working with Linux environments, SSH, job schedulers, and long-running training jobs—experience that I see as directly transferable to cloud-based AI workflows.
